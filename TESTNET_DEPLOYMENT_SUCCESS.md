## 🔧 Update Your Configuration Files

You need to update 2 files with the contract address:

### 1. Update `backend/.env`

Find this line:
```env
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
```

Change it to:
```env
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2cd2936c4D34B926100ceE1EcF279E6E04ba5234
```

Also update:
```env
CHAIN_ID=11155111
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/35d7e3d9e86943c295610f44c0b37815
```

### 2. Update `frontend/.env`

Find this line:
```env
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
```

Change it to:
```env
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2cd2936c4D34B926100ceE1EcF279E6E04ba5234
```

Also update:
```env
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Test

### Step 1: Upload Images to IPFS (5 minutes)

```bash
cd art-generator
npm run upload
```

This will upload your 15 Cosmic Guardians images to IPFS using Pinata.

### Step 2: Import NFTs to Database (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run import
```

This will add all 15 NFTs to your backend database.

### Step 3: Start Backend Server (2 minutes)

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Should see: "Server running on port 3001"

### Step 4: Start Frontend (2 minutes)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Should see: "Local: http://localhost:5173"

### Step 5: Test Minting! (5 minutes)

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Connect MetaMask (make sure you're on Sepolia network)
3. Go to "Mint" page
4. See your 15 Cosmic Guardians
5. Try minting one (costs 0.05 test ETH)
6. Check "My NFTs" page

## 🎨 Your Cosmic Guardians Collection

**15 Unique NFTs Ready:**
- 2 Legendary (0.20 ETH each)
- 4 Epic (0.12 ETH each)
- 5 Rare (0.08 ETH each)
- 4 Uncommon (0.05 ETH each)

**Total Collection Value:** 1.35 ETH (~$4,050)

## 📊 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Update backend/.env with contract address
- [ ] Update frontend/.env with contract address
- [ ] Upload images to IPFS
- [ ] Import NFTs to database
- [ ] Start backend server
- [ ] Start frontend website
- [ ] Connect MetaMask to Sepolia
- [ ] Test minting an NFT
- [ ] Verify NFT appears in "My NFTs"
- [ ] Check NFT on OpenSea testnet

---

## 🌐 After Testing - Deploy to Polygon Mainnet

Once everything works on testnet, we'll deploy to Polygon mainnet:

### Requirements:
- $5 worth of MATIC tokens
- Same process, different network
- Cost: ~$0.50-$1

### Command:
```bash
cd contracts
npm run deploy:polygon
```

### What Changes:
- Real blockchain (not test)
- Real money (MATIC)
- NFTs have real value
- Listed on OpenSea for real

## 💡 What Happened During Deployment

### 1. Compilation
Your Solidity smart contract was compiled into bytecode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can understand.

### 2. Deployment Transaction
A transaction was sent to the Sepolia network containing:
- Your contract bytecode
- Constructor parameters (name, symbol, price, etc.)
- Gas payment (from your test ETH)

### 3. Contract Creation
The network created your contract at address `0x2cd2936c4D34B926100ceE1EcF279E6E04ba5234`

### 4. Verification
Your source code was uploaded to Etherscan so everyone can verify it matches the deployed bytecode.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### On Testnet:
- Everything is FREE
- Use test ETH (no real value)
- Perfect for testing
- NFTs have no real value

### On Mainnet (Polygon):
- Costs real money (~$1)
- NFTs have real value
- Can sell for real money
- Listed on OpenSea
